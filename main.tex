\section{Task Outline}
After progressing through elaboration I and identifying the proposed technologies, it is now required to test these tools to see whether they can solve the predetermined pains and gains. These tools were categorised into two alternative routes. The first included two different software packages called \textbf{Open Semantic Search} and \textbf{Tropy}. Whilst the second utilises \textbf{excel}, a traditional offline tool that will be combined with the \textbf{cloudstor sync client} (CSC). Through this second elaboration I am hoping to achieve a desired outcome of uncovering whether these tools can resolves the pains from the scoping exercise and achieve criteria specified in the previous elaboration.


\section{Elaboration Tests}
To examine these tools, individual components required for this POC will be tested to see if they meet user expectations. Each component will be run individually to document validity and credibility. Recording of these tests will be completed in my learning journal, however outcomes will be discussed below. The key questions that will orient the tests include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is this tool compatible with both mobile and desktop?
\item Is this tool compatible with all data types?
\item Does this tool organise files with rich metadata?
\item Does this tool allow for editing of data?
\item Can this tool operate offline?
\item Does this tool have a reliable storage system?
\end{itemize}
